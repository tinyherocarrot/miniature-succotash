###The Pitch
#####How Might We...
*Make exchanging info with other professionals at an event streamlined and effective, by implementing an application to easily exchange and save business profile information, along with time and date of the meeting.*

###App Functionalities
1. Login/authorization for user
2. User Profile: blurb, vCard (contact information, professional social links)
3. Save vCards (in order of most recent), linked to the time and place of meeting, notes, add labels
4. Search contacts by vCard fields, personal notes, by labels
5. (Reach: QRCode Scanning )

###User Stories
#####A professional at a meetup/convention/fair:
Mary goes to a meetup for blockchain in her area.
1. WANTS: She would like to be able to network and easily save information about people she meets, without all the fumbling of exchanging emails or business cards. She also wants to make notes about the conversation or other things she learns about her new connections.
2. DOES: She exchanges a generated key with people she meets. After entering the other person's generated key, she can make a quick note about them to save.
#####Later...
Mary wants to get in contact with someone she met last week.
1. WANTS: She would like to recall contact info of someone she met at some blockchain meetup a while ago... She would also like to recall what they might have talked about.
2. DOES: She goes to her 'saved', and searches based on what she remembers. She can find contact info, along with where and when she met that person.
